# weather-app

Scenario

The team at a European travel agency is trying to increase travel bookings. 
To do this, they want to provide an ability for their website visitors to look up a weather forecast for major European cities.

The project 

So, I created a webpage - using HTML, JavaScript and CSS - that will retrieve weather forecasts from an external service. 
This feature helps the agency maximize their travel bookings and sales through their website.

Objectives

- Provide ability for website users to look weather forecasts for major European cities;
- Keep website visitors on the website longer;
- Increase online bookings.

Notes 

In this project, I use 7Timer API, which is free of charge and does not require any API keys.
